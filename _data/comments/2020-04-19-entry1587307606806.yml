  \ of about 600,000 people about an hour’s drive from Wuhan in Hubei province, the\
  \ municipal government said on Saturday.\r\n\r\nZeng was initially placed under\
  \ administrative detention on March 27. While the term was not stated, the government\
  \ said she was detained again on April 9, but this time on criminal grounds."
