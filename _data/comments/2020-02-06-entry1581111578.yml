event: 'Meanwhile, the ruling Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has already started leveraging
  the crisis for propaganda by lionizing cadres leading containment efforts.

  The 2019-nCoV outbreak is infecting some 2,000 people daily in China and has spread
  to at least 25 countries.

  Xi, burnished by a resurgent cult of personality, has amassed more power than any
  Chinese leader since Mao Zedong.

  Rather than assess issues through a purely governance lens, China’s bureaucracy
  is forced to balance both technocratic and political concerns.

  But the crisis has already demonstrated that the centralization of political power
  under Xi has made Chinese society brittle.'
